# Heroes-of-Pymoli-Analysis
As Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company, I performed an analysis of purchase and demographic data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. This is a free game, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. Through breaking down Heroes of Pymoli's data, I was able to gather meaningful insights about popular items and player demographics.
